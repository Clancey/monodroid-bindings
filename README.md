monodroid-bindings
==================

This module contains Mono for Android API bindings for popular Android
libraries that developers can resuse in their own applications.

If you would like to get your binding added, contact us.

This also serves as a "HOWTO" for binding additional libraries.


Building
========

Building the bindings requires Mono for Android 4.2 or later.

To build, run `make` in the toplevel directory:

    $ make
